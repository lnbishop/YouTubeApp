Matthew Allbright: So one thing i'm trying to tackle is how to arrange the list of urls so that it stays as the url's
that is imported from the API data.

One idea is to create a series of divs and load the urls into the divs, then somehow figure out how to rearrange them.
I think that aspect is going to be the biggest hurdle. The YouTube url import was pretty much done for us in that 
in-class youtube example.
